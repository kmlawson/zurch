# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- **Max Results (-x flag) Behavior**: The `-x` flag now correctly applies the limit as the final operation after all other processing (including deduplication) is complete. This ensures that the specified number of results are returned from the final processed set, as per the `GEMINI.md` specification.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-13

### Added
- **Debug Mode Purple Duplicates**: When `-d` flag is used, all duplicate items are displayed in purple color
  - Selected (best) items remain in normal colors for easy identification
  - Duplicates show purple icons and purple text
  - Maintains full duplicate detection and logging information

### Enhanced
- **Visual Improvements**: 
  - Changed book icon from ðŸ“• (red book) to ðŸ“— (green book) for better visual distinction
  - Enhanced color coding system for duplicate identification
  - Improved visual hierarchy in debug mode output

### Technical
- Added `is_duplicate` flag to `ZoteroItem` dataclass
- New `format_duplicate_title()` function for purple text formatting
- Updated `format_item_type_icon()` to support purple color for duplicates
- Modified deduplication logic to include marked duplicates in debug mode

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-13

### Added
- **Automatic Duplicate Detection and Removal**: Major new feature that intelligently removes duplicates
  - Matches items based on title, author names, and publication year
  - Prioritizes items with PDF/EPUB attachments over those without
  - Falls back to most recent modification date for tie-breaking
  - Works automatically with both `-n` (name search) and `-f` (folder search)
  - Reduces clutter and shows only the best version of each item

- **Duplicate Control Options**:
  - `--no-dedupe` flag to disable automatic deduplication
  - Debug logging shows detailed duplicate detection process
  - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting duplicate issues

### Enhanced
- **Search Results**: 
  - Example: "World History in People's Republic" reduced from 8 duplicates to 2 unique items
  - "AHR Conversation" searches reduced from 17 duplicates to 6 unique items
  - Maintains all existing functionality while providing cleaner results

### Technical
- New `duplicates.py` module with `DuplicateKey` class for consistent identification
- Smart selection algorithm in `select_best_duplicate()` function
- Maintains original ordering and collection grouping after deduplication
- Comprehensive debug logging for duplicate detection process

## [0.4.4] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **Grouped Folder Display with Separations**: Enhanced `-f` command for multiple matching folders
  - Clear visual separations between different collections
  - Collection headers show full hierarchical paths and item counts
  - Continuous numbering across folders for interactive mode compatibility
  - Maintains alphabetical sorting within each folder

### Enhanced
- **Multi-Folder Search Results**: 
  - Example output format: `=== World History (13 items) ===` followed by items
  - Then `=== 0 Journals > J of World History (24 items) ===` with its items
  - Provides clear context about which folder each item belongs to

### Technical
- New `get_collection_items_grouped()` method for maintaining collection separation
- Enhanced `display_grouped_items()` function with hierarchical headers
- Improved organization for searches that match multiple collections

## [0.4.3] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **Item ID Lookup**: New `--id` flag to display metadata for specific item IDs
  - Usage: `zurch --id 12345` shows complete metadata for item 12345
  - Useful for investigating specific items found in search results
  - Includes error handling for invalid item IDs

- **Collection Membership Display**: Enhanced metadata views show item collections
  - All metadata displays now include "Collections:" section
  - Shows full hierarchical collection paths where items are stored
  - Works in both `--id` flag usage and interactive mode (`-i`)
  - Helps understand item organization within Zotero library

### Enhanced
- **Metadata Views**: Both interactive selection and direct ID lookup show collection membership
- **Navigation**: Easier to understand relationships between items and their storage locations

### Technical
- New `get_item_collections()` method with recursive CTE for hierarchical paths

- Updated CLI argument parsing and main logic for `--id` flag support

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **Interactive Collection Selection**: `zurch -l -i` now provides interactive mode for collection browsing
  - Displays collections in hierarchical numbered list
  - Select a collection by number to view its contents
  - Automatically runs `-f` on the selected collection
  - Can be combined with `-g` to grab attachments from selected collection

### Enhanced
- **Hierarchical Display for All Collections**: `zurch -l` without search term now shows hierarchical structure
  - Previously showed flat indented list
  - Now uses same hierarchical tree display as filtered searches
  - Provides better visualization of collection organization

### Technical
- Moved interactive functionality to separate `interactive.py` module for better code organization
- Standardized config location for macOS to use `~/.config/zurch/config.json` (same as Linux)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-13

### Breaking Changes
- **Project Renamed**: `clizot` is now `zurch` - a more descriptive name for the Zotero search CLI
  - Command changed from `clizot` to `zurch`
  - Package name changed from `clizot` to `zurch`
  - Configuration directory changed from `~/.config/clizot/` to `~/.config/zurch/`

### Migration
- Uninstall old version: `uv tool uninstall clizot` or `pip uninstall clizot`
- Install new version: `uv tool install zurch` or `pip install zurch`
- Configuration will need to be recreated (automatic discovery will still work)
