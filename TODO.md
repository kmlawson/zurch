## Add -g feature [ ] 

- -g and [number]g copying of the PDF to the current directory should rename the file "[author last name] -" (if available) and by the title of the article (up to a reasonable character limit and carefully sanitized to display correctly on MacOS, Linux, or Windows systems). Example:

Smith - Title of Book.pdf
Title of Book.pdf (if no last name available)
Smith - Truncated Name of Very Long Book Titl.pdf


## Add Tags to meta data [ ] 

When showing the meta data for an item, show the tags it has too in a list: 

**Tags:** China | Gender | History / Modern 

## --showtags feature

When the flag is active, any list of item titles will, in a different color, show the tags divided by "|" for each item on the next line under it.

## clean up -h

The -h is a bit too much with wrapping lines, is there a way to clean it up and make it clearer on small terminal screens, perhaps keeping lines shorter for descriptions of features?
